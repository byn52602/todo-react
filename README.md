# Todos React APP

## What is this APP?
In this app, you can add, delete, submit and edit Todo items. 
To edit items, simply double click on it. 
Once you are done, press the enter key to resubmit. 
This app will persist your data in the browser local storage. 
So whether you reload, close your app or reopened it, you still have access to your to-dos items.

## Why this APP?
Setting up a Todo list is a common task that helps us 
navigate throughout the day with a clear mind. Therefore I wanted to 
utilize my existing HTML, CSS, Javascript skills, 
combined with new knowledge of the React framework to make an Todo List APP.

Thanks to https://ibaslogic.com/, I was able to learn how to build the foundations of this APP. After that I added some personal touch and tyles to this website.
